On January 28, 2025, I was in a lot of pain again due to <u>chronic gastritis</u>. I had tteokbokki for dinner, but perhaps my stomach didn't take it well or maybe I was too stressed from what had happened the day before. 

Starting around 9 PM, the pain was so unbearable that I couldn’t study at all. Actually, rather than feeling like my stomach was burning, it felt as if someone had punched me hard in the stomach, leaving a deep bruise on my stomach lining. It was as if someone struck my upper abdomen with a baseball bat. 

Around 9:30 PM, I took two gastritis-treating tablets before going to bed. But six hours later, at 3:10 AM, I woke up again because of the pain. This time, I took two famotidine-based pills before going back to sleep. Fortunately, when I woke up the next day, my stomach felt better. 

I feel strongly that these kinds of events should be recorded. If I were in pain, I should write down why I was in pain, what I think I did that caused it, and what the problem was. By doing so, I can think about what I need to do to avoid the same pain later on. Plus, if I look up why I was in pain and understand exactly how taking certain kinds of medicine alleviates the symptoms, some of the frustrating questions I previously had may be answered. Most importantly, the notes I keep will become a valuable reference later on.

Returning to the main topic, after briefly looking up the causes of stomach pain and acute gastritis, as well as the medications I took, I found that:
The main ingredients of the pills I took were **dicyclomine hydrochloride** [(link)](https://www.health.kr/searchDrug/result_take.asp?drug_cd=A11AGGGGA3683) and **papaverine hydrochloride**, as well as **famotidine** [(link)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/파파베린).

Dicyclomine hydrochloride helps relieve abdominal pain through a dual-action mechanism as an **antispasmodic** and **anticholinergic agent** [(link)](https://www.carehospitals.com/medicine-detail/dicyclomine-hydrochloride). In other words, it blocks **acetylcholine**, a neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contractions, from acting on specific receptor sites [(link)](https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00804).

*But how are muscle contractions and stomach pain related? How does an anticholinergic drug, which blocks acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction), help relieve stomach pain?*

First, when the **smooth muscles** of the gastrointestinal tract contract involuntarily, it can cause spasms and pain [(link)](https://resources.healthgrades.com/right-care/bones-joints-and-muscles/stomach-muscle-spasm). Anticholinergic **antispasmodic** drugs help by preventing acetylcholine from binding to nerve cell receptors, which in turn **relaxes the smooth muscles** of the digestive tract. In other words, these drugs work by **blocking acetylcholine activity in both the central and peripheral nervous systems** [(link)](https://www.rxlist.com/how_do_anticholinergic_antispasmodic_agents_work/drug-class.htm). This blocking action suppresses **involuntary muscle movements** in various organs, including the stomach and intestines, thereby reducing pain and spasms.

*What exactly is acetylcholine, and does preventing it from binding to nerve cell receptors cause muscle relaxation?*

**Acetylcholine (ACh)** is an organic compound that functions as a **neurotransmitter** in both the **central and peripheral nervous systems** [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine). It is synthesized from **choline** and **acetyl-CoA** and is stored in **synaptic vesicles** at the nerve cell terminals until it is released [(link)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24568-acetylcholine-ach).

Once released, acetylcholine travels across the **synaptic cleft** and binds to two types of receptors:

- **Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR)**
- **Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR)**

Since acetylcholine binding to receptors **triggers muscle contraction**, preventing it from binding to nerve cell receptors results in **muscle relaxation**.

*How does acetylcholine binding to receptors cause muscle contraction?*

#### **1. Release of Acetylcholine (ACh)**

First, **motor neurons** at the **neuromuscular junction** release acetylcholine (ACh). (*Motor neurons are nerve cells that transmit commands from the central nervous system to muscles or glands.* [(link)](https://www.amc.seoul.kr/asan/mobile/healthinfo/body/bodyDetail.do?bodyId=18&partId=B000007))

#### **2. Binding to Receptors**

The released ACh then binds to **nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR)** on the **muscle fiber membrane (sarcolemma)** [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction).

#### **3. Opening of Ion Channels**

This binding opens **ion channels**, allowing **sodium ions (Na⁺) to enter the muscle cell** [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromuscular_junction).

#### **4. Depolarization and Action Potential**

The influx of sodium ions **depolarizes** the muscle fiber, triggering an **action potential**.

#### **5. Muscle Contraction**

This action potential leads to a series of intracellular events that result in **muscle contraction**.
