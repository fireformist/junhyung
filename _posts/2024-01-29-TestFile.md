Mathematical epidemiology is a field that utilizes mathematical models to understand and predict the spread of infectious diseases within populations. The history of mathematical epidemiology can be traced back to the early 20th century, with the development of compartmental models. While I don't have explicit references to individual sources, I can provide a general overview based on commonly known developments in the field.

1.  **Kermack and McKendrick Model (1927):**
    
    -   In 1927, British mathematicians W.O. Kermack and A.G. McKendrick introduced a simple compartmental model to describe the spread of infectious diseases. This model, known as the Kermack-McKendrick model or the SIR model (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered), divided the population into three compartments to represent individuals in different stages of infection.
    $$ \frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta \cdot S \cdot I \\ \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \cdot S \cdot I - \gamma \cdot I \\ \frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma \cdot I $$
    $$
\begin{align*} S & : \text{Number of susceptible individuals,} \\ I & : \text{Number of infectious individuals,} \\ R & : \text{Number of recovered individuals,} \\ \beta & : \text{Transmission rate (probability of transmission per contact),} \\ \gamma & : \text{Recovery rate (fraction of infectious individuals recovering per unit time),} \\ t & : \text{Time.} \end{align*}
$$

2.  **Contributions from Ronald Ross and George MacDonald:**
    
    -   Ronald Ross, a British physician, and George MacDonald, a British epidemiologist, made significant contributions to the development of mathematical models for infectious diseases in the early 20th century. Ross, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1902 for his work on malaria, laid the groundwork for understanding the transmission of vector-borne diseases.

3.  **Anderson and May's Infectious Disease Dynamics (1991):**
    
    -   The book "Infectious Disease Dynamics" by Roy M. Anderson and Robert M. May, published in 1991, is a seminal work that provides a comprehensive introduction to mathematical epidemiology. It covers various models and their applications in understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases. This book is widely used as a reference in the field.

4.  **Advancements in Computational Techniques:**
    
    -   With the advent of computers and improvements in computational techniques, mathematical epidemiology has seen increased sophistication in model development and simulation. Complex models incorporating spatial and temporal factors have been developed to better capture the dynamics of disease transmission.

5.  **Network Models and Agent-Based Modeling:**
    
    -   In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on network models and agent-based modeling to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in populations with varying degrees of connectivity. These approaches provide a more realistic representation of contact patterns among individuals.

6.  **Application to Specific Diseases:**
    
    -   Mathematical epidemiology has been applied to study various infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, influenza, Ebola, and more recently, COVID-19. Models are adapted and refined based on specific characteristics of the pathogens and the populations involved.
