## Beta-lactam Antibiotics

Bacterial cell walls contain **peptidoglycan**, a polymer consisting of sugar chains cross-linked by short peptide chains. This structure provides **mechanical strength** and protection against osmotic lysis.

Beta-lactam antibiotics target **penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)**, which are enzymes responsible for the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis. These PBPs include:

- **Transpeptidases** – responsible for cross-linking peptidoglycan strands.
- **Carboxypeptidases & Endopeptidases** – involved in remodeling and maintaining the bacterial cell wall.

The core structure of all beta-lactm antibiotics is the **beta-lactam ring**, a four-membered cyclic amide.

### **Mechanism of Inhibition:**

1. **Binding to PBPs**: Beta-lactams mimic the **D-Ala-D-Ala** terminal of peptidoglycan precursors, allowing them to bind to PBPs irreversibly.
2. **Inhibition of Transpeptidation**: By binding to PBPs, beta-lactams **prevent the cross-linking** of peptidoglycan strands.
3. **Weakened Cell Wall**: The inhibition of transpeptidation results in **a structurally compromised cell wall** that cannot withstand osmotic pressure.
4. **Cell Lysis**: Due to the weakened wall, the bacterium **swells and bursts** as water enters via osmosis, leading to **bacterial death**.

Apart from inhibiting PBPs, beta-lactams also trigger **autolysins**, bacterial enzymes that degrade peptidoglycan. Normally, autolysins function in cell wall turnover, but when beta-lactams disrupt new cell wall formation, these enzymes become **unregulated** and contribute to cell wall destruction, further accelerating **bacterial death**.

Beta-lactam antibiotics are highly selective for bacteria because **human cells lack peptidoglycan**. Since our cells do not possess **PBPs or a bacterial cell wall**, beta-lactams do not harm human cells.

Bacteria can develop resistance through several mechanisms:

- **Beta-lactamase enzymes**: These enzymes hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring, rendering the antibiotic inactive (e.g., **penicillinase, cephalosporinase**).
- **Altered PBPs**: Some bacteria (e.g., MRSA) produce PBPs with low affinity for beta-lactams.
- **Efflux Pumps**: Actively pump out the antibiotic before it reaches PBPs.
- **Porin Mutations**: Gram-negative bacteria can modify their outer membrane porins, preventing antibiotic entry.

**Solution to Resistance**:

- **Beta-lactamase inhibitors** (e.g., clavulanic acid, tazobactam) are combined with beta-lactams to inhibit bacterial enzymes.
- **Newer beta-lactams** (e.g., carbapenems) have enhanced stability against beta-lactamases.

Beta-lactam antibiotics work by **inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis** via blocking PBPs, leading to bacterial lysis. Their effectiveness is limited by bacterial resistance mechanisms, which are countered using beta-lactamase inhibitors and novel antibiotic designs.
