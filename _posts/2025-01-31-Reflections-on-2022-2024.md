Looking back at my mostly post-pandemic, past three years (2022-2024), I realize: there have been so many days—happy days, sad days, good days, painful days.  

The fact that I’ve made it this far is largely due to God’s grace (or, for those who don’t believe, the grace of the heavens).  

**"You reap what you sow."** 

This is a verse from the Bible—what I plant, I will eventually harvest.  

Throughout January 2025, the more I thought about it, the more I felt like I wasn’t investing in my future. No—worse, I felt like I was ruining it with my own hands—by a combination of complacency, laziness, and irresponsibility, 

I’m not writing this in a state of emotional turmoil. If I simply take an honest look at my actions this month, I don’t feel like I’ve grown into a more mature, thoughtful adult.  

Maybe it’s because I only remember my mistakes? Every time I try to let things go, those embarrassing memories from my past resurface, crystal clear, as if they happened just yesterday.  

Changing my thoughts, changing my actions, and improving myself—it all feels impossibly difficult. No matter how much I pray, no matter how much I plead not to be consumed by temptation, no matter how many times I break down and repent before God,   

I always find myself returning to the same state, like a dog going back to its vomit, like a washed pig rolling in the mud again.  

My mind and soul become tainted once more, filled with worldly concerns, desires, and impurities. This is my honest confession.  

The New Testament says that Jesus Christ prayed "until His sweat became like drops of blood."  

Even the greatest  in Christian history did that. So, really, is it any surprise that someone like me so easily falls prey to the devil?  

Still, even though I know I will keep failing, falling, making mistakes, getting hurt, regretting, comparing, and getting mired in jealousy—  

I pray that I will also keep repenting, praying, learning, getting back up, healing, letting go, and choosing to carry on.  

On days when I struggle—when guilt and regret over the past come crashing down on me—if I look up at the sky, the bright, sunlit sky looks so peaceful and beautiful.  

That is, compared to this world, which is filled with suffering, evil, and contradictions.


And I wonder, though I’m trapped in reality, how wonderful it would be to become one with that stillness, that calm, that radiant harmony.  

(Of course, this is not to complain about my life. I fully acknowledge and understand that I am blessed with a much easier life than many others. The difficult days I speak of are the days when my heart feels heavy.) 


Professor June Huh once said, *"Specifities are always insignificant."*  

That’s why, when I write in this blog, I won’t set specific goals.  

I’ll simply express my thoughts as they are—raw, honest, like a stream of consciousness.  

After all, this is for me. A record of what I was thinking at this moment, why I felt this way—so I don’t forget.  

Unlike my past blog entries, I don't have a specific goal in mind for this particular piece of writing. Things like job preparation and building my resume are separate issues, and now is not the time to focus on them in detail.  

And as the Proverbs says, no one truly knows their own path. Even if we make plans, it is God who leads the way.  

Anyhow, this entry has gotten long. Maybe it sounds scattered, unstructured, even meaningless.  

But someday, I hope to look back on this and remember—  

What I was thinking in January and February of 2025, and why I thought that way.  

For now, I bury this entry like a seed in the storage of my memory. I don’t know what kind of fruit it will bear in the future.  

Will it bring me understanding? Or will it stir feelings of sympathy and pity?  

I’ll end with the closing words of Professor June Huh's graduation speech at SNU:  

*"Be kind to each other, and to yourself. And may that kindness reach the future versions of ourselves, wherever they may be."*
