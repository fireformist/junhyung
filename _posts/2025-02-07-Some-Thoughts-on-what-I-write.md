I have a habit of <u>recording things</u> when I’m feeling unwell or under stress.

Whenever I’m stressed, <u>I write down what the problem was, whether it was due to my own mistake, and if so, what I should change to avoid making the same mistake</u> in the future. For example, when I was completing my mandatory military service at the Korean Air Force, I used to write down the things my superiors pointed out, the things they told me to fix, and all the challenges I had to endure during my mentally exhausting time as a first-class airman. I remember struggling to keep track of everything just to survive that period. After being honorably discharged, I started recording not only my mental stress but also my <u>physical symptoms</u>. I’ve had frequent <u>health issues like acute gastritis</u>, and I’ve noticed worsening conditions like <u>hyperhidrosis</u> over time. (I first experienced hyperhidrosis in high school, while my gastritis started in my second year of university.)

So, I started keeping records of my symptoms, my hospital visits, and possible causes of my illnesses—what I did that might have triggered them and what the underlying issues might be. Through this, I kept thinking about what I could do to <u>prevent getting sick</u>. I realized that when I took the time to <u>understand why I was sick</u> and <u>how treatments worked</u>, I could finally find answers to the frustrating questions that had always bothered me—why I was experiencing these issues and how I could reduce my symptoms. For example, with <u>hyperhidrosis</u>, it was uncomfortable shaking hands with people, embarrassing to grab a handrail on the bus when my palms were drenched in sweat, and frustrating when my books got soaked while reading. When I went to the pharmacy to buy products like Driclor (an antiperspirant), I even heard the pharmacist say, *"<u>Hyperhidrosis ought to be regarded as a serious illness</u>."* But since no one in my family or friends seemed to have it, I often felt it was unfair—*Why is this only happening to me?* That question led me to research the causes of hyperhidrosis, the mechanism behind treatments like Driclor, and even the principles of iontophoresis therapy. <u>Writing down what I learned during personal research became a useful reference over time</u>, and I found myself continuing the habit.

This habit of writing to understand things better is what eventually sparked my interest in medicine.
