I have a habit of recording things when I’m feeling unwell or under stress.

Whenever I’m stressed, I write down what the problem was, whether it was due to my own mistake, and if so, what I should change to avoid making the same mistake in the future. For example, when I was completing my mandatory military service at the Korean Air Force, I used to write down the things my superiors pointed out, the things they told me to fix, and all the challenges I had to endure during my mentally exhausting time as a first-class airman. I remember struggling to keep track of everything just to survive that period. After being honorably discharged, I started recording not only my mental stress but also my physical symptoms. I’ve had frequent health issues like acute gastritis, and I’ve noticed worsening conditions like hyperhidrosis over time. (I first experienced hyperhidrosis in high school, while my gastritis started in my second year of university.)

So, I started keeping records of my symptoms, my hospital visits, and possible causes of my illnesses—what I did that might have triggered them and what the underlying issues might be. Through this, I kept thinking about what I could do to avoid getting sick. I realized that when I took the time to understand why I was sick and how treatments worked, I could finally find answers to the frustrating questions that had always bothered me—why I was experiencing these issues and how I could reduce my symptoms. For example, with hyperhidrosis, it was uncomfortable shaking hands with people, embarrassing to grab a handrail on the bus when my palms were drenched in sweat, and frustrating when my books got soaked while reading. When I went to the pharmacy to buy products like Dryclor, I even heard people say, *"Hyperhidrosis is a real medical condition."* But since no one in my family or friends seemed to have it, I often felt it was unfair—*Why is this only happening to me?* That question led me to research the causes of hyperhidrosis, the mechanism behind treatments like Dryclor, and even the principles of iontophoresis therapy. Writing down what I learned became a useful reference over time, and I found myself continuing the habit.

This habit of writing to understand things better is what eventually sparked my interest in medicine.
