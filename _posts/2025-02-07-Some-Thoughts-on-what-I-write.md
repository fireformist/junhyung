How do humans find meaning and create value amidst the countless experiences in life?

Consider for a moment, a scene from *The Matrix* (1999), where main protagonists Neo and Morpheus debate about the nature of reality inside the Construct. <u>What we perceive as reality is, ultimately, just a result of neurotransmitter reactions in the brain</u>. In the same way, even our thoughts are nothing more than the products of chemical reactions.

<u>The intense emotions we feel, the thoughts we contemplate, and even the imaginary worlds we dream of—when examined in purely material terms—are all biochemical reactions triggered by neurotransmitters in the brain</u>. We simply perceive these biochemical reactions as thoughts and imagination.

This leads to another difficult question:

In the debate on free will, <u>our way of thinking and reasoning is fundamentally the result of chemical reactions occurring between neurons and synapses</u>. However, we do not have direct control over these reactions. If that is the case, can we truly make independent decisions and think freely, as proponents of free will argue? Of course, fully addressing this question would go beyond the scope of this discussion.

<u>The key point here is that much of how we think, find meaning, and create value in life is determined by biochemical reactions in our brains that occur beyond our conscious control</u>. These uncontrollable biochemical processes accumulate over time, shaping our thoughts, reasoning, personality, and even our physical and mental states.

This idea might seem unsettling at first. However, <u>the fields of medicine and pharmacy exist precisely to study and regulate such biochemical reactions—in order to alleviate the physical and psychological suffering that all humans inevitably experience</u>. Medications, in particular, are fascinating because they can intervene in irreversible biological and chemical processes that we ourselves cannot consciously control, guiding them toward desirable outcomes.

Personally speaking, I often experience illness—both physically and mentally. <u>Identifying the causes of this suffering and finding solutions to address them are, at their core, problems of biology and chemistry</u>.

This may sound somewhat unusual, but I have a habit of documenting my experiences whenever I fall ill or feel either stressed or depressed. When I encounter very stressful, uncomfortable situations, I record what went wrong, and if I made a mistake, I reflect on how I can avoid repeating it in the future. For example, during my mandatory military service, I kept track of the criticisms I received from senior officers and the tasks they instructed me to improve upon. In particular, I vividly remember struggling through my time as a first-class airman, painstakingly writing down notes to help myself endure the challenges.

After completing my military service, I have continued this habit, not just for mental stress but also for physical ailments. I have suffered from acute gastritis and, over time, have developed worsening symptoms of hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). (I first noticed symptoms of hyperhidrosis in my second year of high school, while my gastritis began in my second year of university.)

<u>By continuously recording my symptoms, visits to the hospital, and the circumstances that led to my illnesses, I reflect on the possible causes and think about how I might prevent future episodes</u>. As I strive to understand the reasons behind my illnesses and explore potential treatments, many of the frustrating, unanswered questions I once had gradually find their answers.

For instance, in the case of hyperhidrosis, I have often struggled with discomfort—feeling self-conscious when shaking hands with others, worrying about sweat accumulating on bus handrails, and even soaking the pages of books while reading. Yet, when I looked around, I noticed that none of my family members or friends seemed to experience the same issue. This led me to repeatedly ask myself, "Why am I the only one suffering from this?"

<u>Through personal research, I learned about the causes of hyperhidrosis, the mechanisms behind medications like Driclor, and the principles of iontophoresis treatment</u>. By documenting these findings, I found that my notes eventually became valuable references, encouraging me to continue keeping records. This habit of writing down my thoughts to deepen my understanding was, in retrospect, the starting point of my interest in pharmaceuticals.

Now, let us consider a different perspective: social contribution—a term that my professors frequently emphasized during my college years. The question, "Why do universities exist?" has one universally accepted answer, agreed upon both within and outside academia:

> <u>Academic institutions (in particular, universities) exist to cultivate talented individuals who can make society a better place and to conduct fundamental research—especially in basic sciences—that serves as the foundation for many industries. Ultimately, these efforts contribute to creating a better world for future generations.</u>

In this context, <u>applying undergraduate and graduate-level chemistry knowledge to pharmaceutical research is a meaningful way to realize the overarching educational mission of universities: social contribution</u>. Our society faces numerous complex challenges. By tackling these problems and gradually finding solutions, we can improve the quality of life for many people and achieve shared prosperity. As a college student with a background in chemistry, I recognize that pharmaceutical research holds immense potential to address pressing issues.

<u>The COVID-19 pandemic, which so catastrophically wrecked the world six years ago, claimed countless lives</u>. It exacerbated mental health crises among my fellow undergraduate students due to lockdown measures, leading to increased rates of depression and loneliness. Even as the pandemic has gradually subsided, many individuals continue to suffer from its long-term effects, including lingering post-COVID symptoms and the rise of chronic conditions such as obesity. <u>Witnessing these challenges firsthand has deepened my awareness of the vital role that biomedical and pharmaceutical research plays in shaping public health and well-being</u>.
