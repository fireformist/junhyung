I am currently a rising sophomore at a university in South Korea. Although currently an economics major, I wish to study about deep learning and neural networks, given my interest in applied mathematics, including statistics. 

Personally, I enjoy music well suited for rainy days, such as warm jazz or piano music from Ghibli Studio. If that sounds a bit dreary, I also enjoy the energy-packed rock-and-roll of AC/DC, the refreshing feel of Mozart, and the not-so-old (still hip actually) music from Queen. (Others on the list include Beethoven's symphonies and Hans Zimmer scores.) 

In terms of film, some of my favorites are *the Dark Knight*, *Inception*, and *Interstellar*, although there are many others on the list not directed by Christopher Nolan. 

My chief philosophical tenet is to never stop learning. Obviously, it will be hard, but by learning new things, I will gain new insights. With these insights, I will find my own path through this incredibly complex world.
